### Created a new repository [Experiment1](https://github.com/Nikhithaadimulam/Experiment1)
Below are concepts I learned:
* Repository:
  Repository is a project folder where the source code and other related files reside.
* Cloning: 
  Created a local copy of the repository by cloning the remote repository stored on cloud.
* Commit: 
  Saving changes on file to the repository with a commit message	
* Branches:
	Used to create parallel(feature) copy of main branch and make changes without affecting the main branch
* Cloning Repo to Local Desktop:
	Itâ€™s like creating a local copy of the remote repository on the local machine
* Push: Pushing local repository committed changes to remote Repository:
* Pull: 
	Used to fetch latest changes of remote repository into the local repository
* Pull Request: 	
	A Pull request is a merge request created to merge a branch with committed changes into another branch
* Forks:
	Fork is a copy of the original repository. This is useful when one wants to make changes to the project without affecting the original project.
* Issues:
	Issues section is used to report any glitches, feature requests or bugs found. Issues section is a place where any person with access can see and track the updates posted.
* Markdown:
	Markdown is used to format and style text in issues, pull requests, and files. It is helpful to format the information and make it eye catchy.

### My likes & dislikes about the content of this course:
#### Likes:
* Learning about version control system is exciting.
* This Version control system will be very helpful in real time scenarios for collaborative software development.
#### Dislike:
* Few advanced concepts are understandable only after lots of practice & hands-on experience.

### What is confusing?
* Pull request to merge from two seperate branches is little confusing. I need to learn more about it. 

### What would I like to see more? 
Course consists of valuable content like GitHub, Azure Fundamentals, Azure data Fundamentals and Google cloud platform. More depth knowledge on such valuable content will be very helpful.

### What would be interesting or helpful to my learning journey?
Scope of having practical knowledge by building mini projects would be interesting and helpful.
